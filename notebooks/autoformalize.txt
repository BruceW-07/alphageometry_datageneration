Here are some examples of the formalization with the YAML format:
Example 1: A, C, B are point such that triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle. D is the mirror image of B across line AC. Let G, E, F be points such that EFG is a right triangle, with EF perpendicular to EG. H is a points such that H is a point where line CF is the same as line HBandH is on perpendicular bisector of line DF.
```

    let: [A, B, C]
    symbol: ieq_triangle
- - args: [D, B, A, C]
    let: [D]
    symbol: angle_mirror
- - args: [E, F, G]

    let: [H]
    symbol: eqdistance
  - args: [H, D, F]

```
Example 2: Points A, B, & C are defined such that triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle. D is a points such that D is on the circumference of circle centered at A with radius AC.
```
- - args: [A, B, C]
    let: [A, B, C]
    symbol: ieq_triangle
- - args: [D, C, A]
    let: [D]
    symbol: on_circle
```
Example 3: Define points C, A, and B such that C, A, & B is a right angle isosceles triangle with the right angle at A. Points D, G, F, and E are defined such that G & F are constructed such that DEFG forms a square.
```
- - args: [A, B, C]
    let: [A, B, C]
    symbol: risos
- - args: [D, E, F, G]
    let: [D, E, F, G]
    symbol: isquare
```

Now formalize the following geometry problem and answer only with the formalized YAML format:
B, A, C are defined such that ABC is a triangle ABC, such that B and C is double in length to that of A and B. D is a points such that D is on a line through B and parallel to line CA.
