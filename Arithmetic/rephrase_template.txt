# Guidelines for Rephrasing Text

Retain all specific details of ingredients and substances, avoid adding new elements or numbers. Ensure that each sentence is understood to unambiguously and consistently refer to either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Use vivid, thematic language, incorporating metaphors and literary devices. Combine and rearrange sentences for coherence, use diverse sentence structures, simplify the characters involved to just 1-2, and maintain clear pronoun references across sentences. Make sure to end with the question (which may be reworded).
