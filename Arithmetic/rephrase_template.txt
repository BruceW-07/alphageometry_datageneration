# Guidelines for Rephrasing Text

1. **Preserve Key Information:**
   - Ensure that all specific numbers, terms, and descriptors are accurately retained.
   - Avoid introducing new elements that might change the original meaning or detail.
   - Don't forget to include the question at the end, but feel free to reword the question as well.

2. **Enhance Language and Theme:**
   - Use vivid and thematic language that matches the context of the original text.
   - Incorporate metaphors or literary devices where appropriate to make the text more engaging.

3. **Improve Structural Flow:**
   - Combine sentences to reduce redundancy and improve coherence.
   - Rearrange sentences to create a logical progression of ideas. For sentences that are about some process that produces a product, occasionally you should rearrange that sentence to mention the product first and then describe the process and ingredients after.
   - Where appropriate, rearrange phrases and clauses in the sentence for more diverse and complex sentence structures.

4. **Maintain Clarity with Pronouns:**
   - Use pronouns to avoid repetition, but ensure that itâ€™s always clear which nouns the pronouns are referring to.
   - Introduce the noun clearly before using a pronoun and avoid using multiple pronouns back-to-back that could refer to different subjects.

5. **Check for Consistency:**
   - Ensure that the tone and style are consistent throughout the text.
   - Review the text to make sure that thematic elements introduced are maintained consistently across the rephrased version.
