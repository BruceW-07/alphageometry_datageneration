We want to creatively describe the following simple python function.

```python
def f(x: float, y: float) -> float:
	if y == 0:
		y += 1e-7
	return 3 * 2 / y - (8 + 8 + x / y) + (10 + (x + 2) - (6 - y / (9 - 4)))
```

The description should qualitatively describe the function's behavior, but with an emphasis on intuition and creativity, rather than quantitative precision. Also, we are using this function for our game, so the description should be motivated by the idea and theme of the game. Our theme is a game where you are a wizard who can cast spells to manipulate the world around you using gems, potions, and other magical items.

With this in mind, write a creative description of the function `f(x, y)` that is up to 3 sentences long.
