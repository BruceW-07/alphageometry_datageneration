# Guidelines for generating new geometry problems
Here are a few examples of Geometry problems in natural language. Your job is to produce {num_problems} more such problems. Pay special attention to match average problem complexity to IMO standard.
Examples:
{problems}
Each new line should contain a new problem. Nothing else not even problem serial numbers.
