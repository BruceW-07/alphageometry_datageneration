The witch adds portions of goblin earwax and moon gems to create a elixir that initiates a reaction, giving measures of troll juice. How many measures of troll juice remain?", "answer": 143.0, "rephrase": "In a mystical realm where alchemy and magic meld seamlessly, the thaumaturge meticulously empowered 10 sun stones with the might of 2 dwarf's beards, crafting essential measures of chimera essence. Subsequently, the sorceress, drawing upon the potency of this essence, intermingled it with 9 ogre's beards, sparking a transformative reaction that birthed ogre's tears. These tears, blended masterfully with 9 sun crystals by the enchantress, gave rise to a concoction that, through its own reaction, conjured portions of goblin earwax.  The wizard, not to be outdone, exponentiated 5 phoenix claws with 2 moon stones, thus creating luminescent moon gems. The witch, harnessing these gems, combined them with the earwax-derived portions, initiating a mystical reaction that ultimately yielded measures of troll juice.
